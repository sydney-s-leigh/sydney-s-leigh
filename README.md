# SYDNEY LEIGH

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Sydney Leigh and I've been coding since I was 11 years old back in 1997 at summer camp doing C++. I went to Mississippi State University for Computer Science, graduated with a Master's degree in 2011. I majored in Computer Science, I have a minor in Software Engineering, and my concentration was in Cyber Security. Over the years I have done many passion projects in many different languages including:

- C
- C++
- C#
- Visual Basic
- Java
- JavaScript
- Python
- Assembly
- PHP
- Ruby
- Perl
- Lua
- R
- And more...

I've touched on various platforms including everything from windows desktop apps, to cross platform apps, to mobile apps, to high performance computing apps. Computers have been a major part of my life, I've always had a passion for them, and I never stop learning. I'm hoping to be active on here more as I am entering into more of a public role.
